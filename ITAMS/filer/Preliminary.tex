\chapter{Preliminary}

This report is written by two 7th semester electrical engineering students at Aarhus school of Engineering, Aarhus University. This report should be read as the result of a preliminary technological research for a system as described in chapter \ref{Intro}.\\
The project development was not based upon a requirement specification or similar, but more on an idea. The project has gone through these four phases:\\
\\
$\bullet$ Project concept/idea development\\
$\bullet$ System architecture definition\\
$\bullet$ Implementation\\
$\bullet$ System test\\

Since the project was done very iteratively as many as possible errors/bugs found in system test were tried fixed by doing system implementation again.\\
These phases also form the main structure of the report with the purpose of guiding the reader through our process.\\

\section{Work distribution}
During the project the group have had the following work distribution:\\
\textbf{Nicolai Glud:}\\
\hspace*{1cm} RGM2000 GPS module\\
\textbf{Johnny Kristensen:}\\
\hspace*{1cm} Nokia 3310/5110 display\\
The rest of the implementation have been more or less shared upon both of us, since we have both been working on these.
