\chapter{Technical considerations}
The following chapter contains our technical considerations and choices along with advantages and disadvantages for the possible alternative solutions. \\

\section{Technical considerations and choices}
We started out with a screen and a GPS module as peripherals. The first technical considerations we made was to add the magnetometer to the project. We decided that while it is nice to know where you are by GPS location, it is useless without knowing which direction you are going.\\

We wanted to make sure that we updated the position from the GPS module at least every second. This would be done with scheduling in a RTOS and in return this would ensure that every task would be run with the proper priority. This feature was on our nice to have list.\\

We chose to implement a battery powered power supply for our system so that we could venture outside to test the system while also getting closer to an actual hand-held device. \\
