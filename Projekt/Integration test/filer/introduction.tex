\section{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to provide tests for each component along with test for connecting and integrating components of the Charcot foot prevention system. This document will entail tests done by the developers of this project and will not be supplied to all stakeholders.

\section{Scope}
The scope of this document is to provide an insight into the tests used to verify functionality for the system. The tests described will by no means be exhaustive, meaning we will not test for most failure scenarios and some functions. The tests are ment to provide a basis for thought about how to improve the system or specific functionality of the system.
