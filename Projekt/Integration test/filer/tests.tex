\chapter{Unit Tests}
\section{CDU}
%% The hardware tests of the CDU
This section contains the hardware and software unit tests of the CDU.
\subsection{Hardware}
In order to test the hardware of the CDU, a series of test points was put on the circuitry. External hardware will be needed for some tests. This will be stated clearly if needed.
\subsubsection{Test case 1: 3.3 volt power supply}
\textbf{Purpose:}\\
The purpose of this test is to test the 3.3 volt circuitry of the power supply block in the CDU.\\

\textbf{Procedure:}\\
Apply 20 V on the P+ and P- pins. Measure voltage between 3v3TEST pin and GNDPIN with an oscilloscope.\\

\textbf{Expected Result:}\\
3.3 volts are measured.\\

\textbf{Actual Result:}\\
-\\

\textbf{Comment and remarks:}\\
-\\

\subsubsection{Test case 2: Communication to bus}
\textbf{Purpose:}\\
The purpose of this test is to test the communication to bus circuitry.\\

\textbf{Procedure:}\\
Apply 20 V on the P+ and P- pins. Between B+ and B- pins put a circuit of 4.7 volt Zener diode and a 5 ohm resistor. Apply 10 kHz signal to INPUTTEST pin. Observe AC coupled signal between SenseTEST pin and GNDPIN with an oscilloscope.\\

\textbf{Expected Result:}\\
10 kHz signal is observed.\\

\textbf{Actual Result:}\\
-\\

\textbf{Comment and remarks:}\\
-\\

\subsubsection{Test case 3: Voltage reference in receiver circuit}
\textbf{Purpose:}\\
The purpose of this test is to test the voltage reference in receiver circuitry.\\

\textbf{Procedure:}\\
Apply 20 V on the P+ and P- pins. Between B+ and B- pins put a circuit of 4.7 volt Zener diode and a 5 ohm resistor. Measure voltage between REFTEST pin and GNDPIN with an oscilloscope.\\

\textbf{Expected Result:}\\
0.43 volts are measured.\\

\textbf{Actual Result:}\\
-\\

\textbf{Comment and remarks:}\\
-\\

\subsubsection{Test case 4: Communication from bus}
\textbf{Purpose:}\\
The purpose of this test is to test the communication from bus circuitry\\

\textbf{Procedure:}\\
Apply 20 V on the P+ and P- pins. Between B+ and B- pins put a circuit of 4.7 volt Zener diode, a 5 ohm resistor and a BAV21 diode and ZVN3306A. As seen in picture!  Apply 10 kHz signal to the sensor nodes response circuit. Observe AC signal between OUTPUTTEST pin and GNDPIN with an oscilloscope.\\

\textbf{Expected Result:}\\
10 kHz signal is observed.\\

\textbf{Actual Result:}\\
-\\

\textbf{Comment and remarks:}\\
-\\
