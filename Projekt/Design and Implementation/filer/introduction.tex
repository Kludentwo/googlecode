\section{Purpose}
This document covers the design and implementation parts of the charcot foot prevention project in a top down approach.

\section{Scope}
The document seeks to explain the design and implementation of the different parts of the system. It does not seek to explain the different solutions or discarded parts, only the parts chosen. The implementations were done based upon the requirements and functionality specified in the requirement specification and the behaviour and structure described in the Architecture.

\section{References}
