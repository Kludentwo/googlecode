\chapter{Project scope}
\textit{This chapter describes the focus of the project development.}

The project will focus on a proof of concept build of a custom communications bus carrying power and communication. The solution should show the possibilities and enable for a smart sensor system.\\
The scope seeks to define the different components and features that the project will contain. The group will lay focus on the items described here:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A central data unit (CDU)
	\subitem $\circ$ Memory
	\subitem  PC interfacing
	\item Multiple sensor nodes
	\subitem $\circ$ data acquisition
	\item Custom power line communication bus 
	\subitem $\circ$ Two way communication
	\subitem $\circ$ One wire
	\subitem $\circ$ Power
	\subitem $\circ$ Multi-slave scheme
	\item PCB prototypes with discrete components
\end{itemize}

The CDU and the sensor nodes will require a communication bus to communicate. The custom power line communication bus will entail acquiring new knowledge and applying the knowledge to design hardware and software from scratch. 
%%PCB prototyping will require refining the groups expertise in routing and print layout. The remainder will require the use of prior knowledge by the group.
