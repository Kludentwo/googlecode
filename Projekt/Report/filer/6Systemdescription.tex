\chapter{System description}
\textit{The description below describes the full system to give an overview and provide a project perspective.}

%The system comprises a Central data unit and an arbitrary number of sensor nodes. The CDU serves as the main component which have several main functionalities:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Contact all sensor node within fixed time intervals
%	\item Store the data locally
%	\item Evaluate data and warn patient if necessary
%	\item Send data to PC for analysis
%\end{itemize}
%The CDU supplies a bus where all sensor nodes are interconnected in a serial fashion. This lowers wiring drastically compared to regular sensors.
%The CDU continuously request measurement data from each sensor node via the bus. The CDU will be powered by a rechargeable battery with enough power to run the system for atleast a day.\\
%The data should be extractable from the CDU to a PC. The connection could be bluetooth, wireless, USB, UART or some other fourth option.
The system is a monitoring system for patients likely to develop charcot foot or in the rehabilitation phase. The system should alert the patient if circumstances where injuries may occur by monitoring the foot temperature.\\
It comprises a main unit which is connected to a sensor daisy chain. The sensor daisy chain is mounted around the foot of the patient located in a sock or shoe. The main unit powers the entire chain of sensors as well as digitally extracting data from each sensor.\\
The data is evaluated by the main unit to alert the patient if needed. The data is stored locally on the main unit for later extraction to a PC for statistics and analysis from professionals eg. doctors, nurses or specialists.\\

The sensor nodes are ASICs and will be covered with epoxy to accommodate the need for hygiene and practically make it possible to wash them. The size of the sensor nodes should be small to be of as little discomfort as possible. The sensor nodes should then be built into a sock or shoe.
