\chapter{Introduction}

The goal of the project is to develop the technology to enable a product comprising of several sensors serially connected on a power line with overlaid communication, which is an extension of the original project description. This report will describe the phases, methods and solutions made and developed throughout the project.\\

The project is build upon the requirements and descriptions made in the preliminary project. Some of which has been changed or modified.\\

During the preliminary project a rough time schedule was composed, dividing the project into four phases.

\begin{itemize}
	\item System Design
	\item Technologies and research
	\item Development
	\item Documentation and finalizing
\end{itemize}

The overall purpose of the project is described in the course catalogue and is shortened to these points:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Use scientific research result and collect technical knowledge into a technical solution
	\item Develop new solutions
	\item Gather and evaluate new knowledge with regards to relevant engineering areas
	\item Complete routine engineering tasks.
	\item Communicate project results to professionals as well as customers
	\item Present project results orally using audio/visual communication tools
	\item Incorporate social, economic, environmental and health and safety consequences in a solution	
\end{itemize}
