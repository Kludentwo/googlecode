\chapter{Structural view}

\section{Introduction}
This chapter describes the structural architecture of the system in a top down approach.\\
The blocks are derived from previous documentation.


\section{System overview}
The system consist of a central data unit and n number of sensors.

\subsection{Block responsibility}
\subsubsection{CDU}
The CDU contact each sensor to collect the data values. This is the stored for later extraction.

\subsubsection{Sensor n}
The sensor measures a physical or biometric parameter such as temperature, movement, humidity etc.
