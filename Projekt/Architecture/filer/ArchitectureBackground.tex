\chapter{Architecture background}

\section{Solution summary}
The project solution offers a dedicated system which is able to accommodate the problem described in the project description. The system should also support extensions of the system. This could be pressure sensors, humidity sensors and more. Therefore this document offers a generic architecture able to support various extensions of the system.\\
The solution consists of a central data unit which can communicate with all sensors in the system. The sensors have an address-range so the central unit are able to automatically detect all sensors and types connected to the system. 

\section{Architectural goals}
The goal of the architecture is to make a structured overview of all aspects of the solution.\\
It should consider all problems in the design of the overall system and present a simple and effective solution to these.\\
Although these solutions must not limit the project in the  implementation.\\

\section{Constraints}
The system isn't able to be connected to sensors already in the market. This is due to the fact that this solution offers its own communication protocol.\\
