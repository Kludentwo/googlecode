\chapter{Project description - extension}
This project description is an extension of the original project description made by Delta. It is made to clarify the borders and content of the bachelor project at engineering collage of Aarhus.\\
The description discards irrelevant subjects or elements of no interest. It ads new elements relevant for the students which is still in the range of the original project description.


\section{background}
The original project description did not fulfil the demands to a bachelor project with regards to new technology and new knowledge. Therefore the original project description needs to be modified to accommodate the group and the supervisors requirements to a bachelors project. \\
This twist of the project has been made in collaboration with the project supervisor.\\
The extension includes new communication protocol development and smart-sensor development etc.\\
Therefore this project will lead more towards a conceptual development project than a real development project.\\
