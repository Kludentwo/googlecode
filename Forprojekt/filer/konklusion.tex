\chapter{Conclusion}
Through the preliminary project the group has thoroughly planned many aspects of the upcoming project.\\ Although not all of the specifications, plans and research are final, it will be a good base for the project.\\ The group found it hard to find much literature in the different fields involved with the project. Further investigation is surely required, but this will be inevitable to avoid.\\ Though there are similar products this project is unique compared with those found in this research and therefore there could potentially be a market for such a product.\\
