\chapter{Conclusion}
We can conclude that the need for this project is real. The prototype will contain the part specified by the project group.\\
A time schedule has been laid out for the project which makes it an achievable goal to have a working prototype based on our specification.\\
We will have to contact health care professions to acquire new knowledge in the field of measuring temperature on feet.\\
There are projects like this already but most of them are not in use or are purely on the experimental state. Although alike there is no project like ours.\\
