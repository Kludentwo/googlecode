\section{Project organizing}
This section describes organizing, planning and other practical aspects of the project.

\subsection{Project flow}
The project work shall follow an iterative process were each phase will be repeated several times. The amount of work put into each task can vary from time to time and will be decided by the group members each time depending on how much is needed. Below is shown a figure describing the project flow. If the method and work flow doesn't work as intended the procedure can be altered at all times during the project.

One iteration will vary in time but must not exceed 3 weeks to ensure the agile development method.\\

\subsection{Meetings}
The project is divided into sprints of 1 week duration. This is to help ensure momentum and agility.\\
Supervisor meetings: A minimum of one per week, preferably the same weekday: suggestion Monday.\\
Daily group meetings: A minimum of 3 per week, preferably more. Suggestion: Thursday, Wednesday and Friday.

\item Closing remarks
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Daily group meetings agenda}

\item What obstacles are impeding my progress?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Work and task distribution}
All tasks and challenges related to the project must be noted on posted notes and hung on the project planning board. This board must be organized to help give an overview of the projects progress and future task.\\
Task distribution will, whenever possible, be allocated at the daily group meetings. It is at all times possible to ad tasks to the board.\\
