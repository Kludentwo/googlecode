\chapter{Abstract}
This report by two seventh semester electronic engineering students at Aarhus School of Engineering, Aarhus University presents an explanation of the groups project: "GeoDude". The purpose of this project is to develop and implement a system for geocaching using modular blocks and a microcontoller.\\
The system has a magnetometer for heading, a GPS module for location and a screen to display this data. Drivers have been made for each module and a set of APIs has been made to utilise the drivers in our project. The project has resulted in a fully functional basis system. Modular block can be added to the system but that would require some improvements. These improvements have been described in the report as well.\\
The group has gained knowledge of how to interface with modular devices that were new to us. The group has also gained more knowledge about the implementation and benefits of subjects from the course.
