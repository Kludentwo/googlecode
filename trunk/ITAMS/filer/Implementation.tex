\chapter{Implementation}
This chapter describes the implementation of GeoDude and some of the considerations aswell as the functionality.









\section{GPS module}
The knowledge about pin assignments for the GPS module, RGM-2000, comes from the website: \url{http://www.tobias-schlegel.de/?page_id=51&lang=en}.\\ 
The communication settings were found in the User Manual (RGM-2000\_user\_manual.pdf which can be found in appendix):\\
\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabular}{|ll|}
    \hline
    Baud rate    & : 4800 \\ \hline
    Data bit     & : 8    \\ \hline
    Parity       & : None \\ \hline
    Stop bit     & : 1    \\ \hline
    Flow control & : None \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
To understand the format output from the GPS module, NMEA-0183, we consulted the wikipedia site as well as observing on Tx in RealTerm (terminal software). The raw NMEA-0183 string looks like this:\\
\begin{verbatim}
$GPGGA,092750.000,5321.6802,N,00630.3372,W,1,8,1.03,61.7,M,55.2,M,,*76
\end{verbatim}
To display this data in an understandable way, we have to cut the string up and "send" it.
