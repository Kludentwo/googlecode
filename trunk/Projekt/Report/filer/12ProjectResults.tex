\chapter{Project results}
\textit{This chapter seeks to present the results from this project.}
\section{CDU}
The CDU prototype has memory, pc communication, sensor communication, sensor power supply and power supply fully implemented. The µ-Controller used has the first iteration of the protocol and line-coding layer implemented. The µ-Controller, memory and pc communication are supplied a power supply connected to the explorer 16 board. The prototype board is powered by an external power supply.

\section{Sensor node}
The sensor node prototype has power supply, logic handler and communication fully implemented. The data acquisition has been partly implemented with a variable resistor as sensor. The logic handler is powered by a power supply connected to the DE2 board. The sensor node prototype is powered by the communication bus.

\section{Custom power line communication bus}
The cusom power line communication bus has been fully implemented on the CDU and the sensor nodes. Two-way communication has been achieved with multiple slaves connected with one wire through the sensors.
