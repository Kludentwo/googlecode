\chapter{Project scope}

\textit{This chapter describes what will be the focus of the project.}

The project will focus on a proof of concept build of a custom communications bus carrying power and communication. The solution should show the possibilities and enable for a smart sensor system.\\
The scope seeks to define the different components and features that the project will contain. The group will lay focus on the items described here:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A central data collection unit
	\item A data acquisition node
	\item Custom power line communication bus 
	\subitem $\circ$ Two way communication
	\subitem $\circ$ One wire
	\subitem $\circ$ Power
	\subitem $\circ$ Multi-slave scheme
	\item PCB prototype with discrete components
	\item PC interfacing
\end{itemize}
The central data collection unit and the data acquisition node will require a communication bus to communicate. The custom power line communication bus will entail acquiring new knowledge and applying the knowledge to design hardware and software from scratch. PCB prototyping will require refining the groups expertise in routing and print layout. The remainder will require the use of prior knowledge by the group.
