\chapter{Clock recovery}
This chapter describes the technology study concerning the clock recovery implemented in the system.
\section{Introduction}
Clock recovery is most commonly used system where data is sent without an accompanying clock signal. The receiver must generate the clock signal from the data signal by using a phase-locked loop. This is also called clock and data recovery or CDR.
