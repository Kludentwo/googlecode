\chapter{Test procedures}
The individual use cases and scenario in the %requirement specification
preproject are tested in the following manner.\\

The results are reported in the following way:
\begin{itemize}[bullet]
\item OK - no errors in test step
\item (OK) - few insignificant errors in the test step found. Read comments.
\item 1,2,3,..-Significant errors found. A detailed description of  the error can be found in a test report. The test report contains the exact error and a probable solution.
\end{itemize}

\section{Functional test cases}
