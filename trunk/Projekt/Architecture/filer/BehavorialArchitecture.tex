\chapter{Behavioural view}

\section{Introduction}
This chapter describes the behavioural architecture of the system.\\
The system behaviour will be described using statemachines and sequence diagrams.\\

\section{Behavioural overview}
The system operates in three main states:\\
$\bullet$ Startup sequence\\
$\bullet$ Normal operation\\
$\bullet$ Data extraction\\
These states full fill the functional requirements from the requirements specification.\\
Below is shown the overall behaviour of the system. The operations will be described in detail later in this chapter.
