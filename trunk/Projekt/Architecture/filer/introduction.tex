\section{Purpose}
The purpose of the document "architecture" is to briefly but precisely describe the architecture of the entire system. The architecture will propose solutions to architectural challenges but not describe any implementation nor will it include any specific technologies.

\section{Scope}
The architecture described in this document is made to break down the system into smaller blocks with simple interfaces. The document is based upon the requirements established in the requirement specification.
