\section{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to present a detailed description of the Charcot foot prevention system. It thoroughly outlines and specifies the features, interfaces, purpose of the system as well as under which constraints the system will operate.\\
The intended audience of the document is the developers, the supervisor and Delta.\\
The requirements of the system may only be changed after a review meeting with the group and/or stakeholders.\\

\section{Scope}
These specifications are limited to the bachelor's project, and not the whole potential system as described in the "Project description" provided from delta.\\
